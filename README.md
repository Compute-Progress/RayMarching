# RayMarching
There is nowhere to hide


Basic Raymarching done. Displays a sphere.

Used surfaces for more speeeeeeed

More generalization. Raymarch takes Object struct that can be filled with any shape's info and sdf;

Need threading for speed. This is really choppy and slow.

# Current Issues

Shapes are displayed with concentric circles and in general the displaying is a little warped

Box is choppy and doesn't display well when zoomed in under light
