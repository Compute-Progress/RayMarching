# RayMarching
There is nowhere to hide


Basic Raymarching done. Displays a sphere.

Used surfaces for more speeeeeeed

Moving around seems to be equivalent to turning for some reason, need to fix that.

Probably will add more SDFs but they all require some form of 3d vectors (if not 4d vectors) and my math library is short on those.

Shoudl try to make made up SDFs and see what happens.
